Thank you for visiting The C++ Workshop! Before we get started we just need to explain some of the unique features of the course, and run through installation and setup for your local environment.

As you work through the material, you'll notice that all practical hands-on elements in the course (which we call exercises and activities) start by walking through a step-by-step reference implementation. We recommend that you try to follow the step-by-step instructions for each practical task.

Taking this approach helps hack your brain, building and reinforcing your learning. It helps with embedding core concepts so that they stick with you for the years ahead. This is also why you'll periodically come across knowledge-check events in the form of informal quizzes. They're not graded and there is zero pressure; they're just there to help you benchmark and lock-in what you've worked through over the duration of the course.

If you find yourself getting a lot of summary questions incorrect, it's worth stepping back, taking a break and revisiting a section another time. This fits in with a general rule; don't be too hard on yourself! Learning is not an instantaneous process, and is best conducted in chunks over a longer period of time. We've structured the course so that you can dip in and out to meet your needs, with quizzes and exercises acting as useful self-diagnostic tools.
Activities and Exercises

## Activities and Exercises

One last thing we should mention is the difference between exercises and activities. Exercises are completely end-to-end and step-by-step.

Activities start off the same as exercises, but leave you with open-ended expansion points for self-study and exploration. It's absolutely worth stepping back and spending some time on extending activities. The process helps to extend your frame of reference and apply your own creative input to what you've just learned, further embedding your new skills. Just in case you run into some roadblocks, at the end of the course you'll still find reference solutions for all activities.

With the methodology of the course out of the way, let's move on to installation and setup!



There are many tools we can use to compile our C++ programs, too many to cover here, so here are some recommendations and a guide on getting started:

## Online Compilers

**cpp.sh** is an online C++ compiler and the one the authors extensively used in this course. Visit [cpp.sh](http://cpp.sh/) and ensure the options are set up as shown:

- Standard: C++14
- Warnings: Many (-Wall)
- Optimization level: Full
- Standard Input: Interactive

That is all we need to do to get started using this compiler. Simply write out your code and hit the run button. Any errors will appear in the compilation tab, and interactive standard input and output will be located on the execution tab. Here is a partial list of online C++ compilers you can use while working on the exercises. If the one you are using becomes sluggish, or you can't find it at all, try another:

**Tutorialspoint C++ compiler**: This [website](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cpp_online.php) allows you to compile a C++ program contained in a single file. It prints error messages from the operating system.

**godbolt compiler explorer**: This [website](https://godbolt.org/) allows you to compile a single file on many different compilers and shows the output assembly language; its UI is a little subtle for some tastes. It prints error messages from the operating system.

**coliru**: This [website](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/) allows you to compile a single file. It prints error messages from the operating system.

**repl.it**: This [website](https://repl.it/languages/cpp) allows you to compile multiple files.

**Rextester**: This website lets you compile a single file using Microsoft Visual C++.

## Installing the Code Bundle

Download the code files from GitHub and place them in a new folder called **C:\Code**. Refer to these code files for the complete code bundle.
